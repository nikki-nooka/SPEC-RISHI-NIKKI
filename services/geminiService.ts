- "explore the world", "show me the globe" -> 'explore'
- "go home", "take me to the dashboard" -> 'welcome'
- "show me the latest news", "what are the alerts" -> 'live-alerts'

2.  For each disease, provide a brief summary, the recent trend ('Increasing', 'Stable', 'Decreasing', or 'Unknown'), an *estimation* of reported cases (as a descriptive string, e.g., 'Hundreds of cases', not a precise number), and describe the most affected demographics.
3.  Write a brief overall summary of the city's current health situation.
4.  For the 'lastUpdated' field, use "Data based on reports from the last 30-60 days".
5.  For the 'dataDisclaimer' field, you MUST use this exact text: "This is an AI-generated summary of publicly available information and is not real-time, verified medical data. Consult official public health sources for accurate statistics."
